This project is a React application that displays a list of products and allows users to view detailed information about each product. It utilizes React Router for navigation between the product list and product detail pages.
The application consists of two main components: ProductList and ProductDetail. The ProductList component fetches and displays a list of products from an external API. Each product is displayed in a card format, and clicking on a card navigates to the ProductDetail component, which fetches and displays detailed information about the selected product.
